### `flower setup`

Set up Flower in your project. Copies the skill files to `.agents/skills/` in your project directory.

# or run directly with npx
npx @flowrr/cli setup
```

**Options:**

| Option        | Description                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-f, --force` | Force setup even if already initialized (will overwrite existing files) |

### `flower doctor`

```

Checks:

- Directory structure (`.agents/skills/` exists)
- All expected skills are present
- All skills have a `SKILL.md` file
- File integrity (compares against original files)

## What is flower?

`flower` is a structured development workflow system that provides AI-assisted skills for:

| Skill                | Purpose                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **flower-design**    | Design and architecture planning |
| **flower-plan**      | Task planning and breakdown      |
| **flower-propose**   | Propose solutions and approaches |

| **flower-implement** | Implementation guidance          |

When you run `flower setup`, these skills are copied to your project's `.agents/skills/` directory where they can be used by AI assistants.
